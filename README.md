# Investigating the relationship between sexual selection, sexual conflict, and sex-biased gene expression
Presented here are the scripts and code used for data analyses in each data chapter of my thesis. Within each directoy are more details about the chapter contents and what tools were used. 

For a brief outline of the chapters:

## Chapter 2: Comparing mating systems and sexual selection pressures across three congeneric species of pipefish that span the continuum of sexual dimorphism
Generation of quantitative measurements of sexual selection based off of pipefish used in experimental breeding populations. Fitness, in terms of mating and reproductive success was generated with genetic parentage analysis.

## Chapter 3: Sexual selection on monomorphic traits is underpinned by evidence of genetic constraints on sex-biased expression in the dusky pipefish, _Syngnathus floridae_
An analysis of RNA-sequencing data across multiple tissues in males and females paired with a quantification of sexual selection pressures from mesocosm expreiments in a species where males and females look nearly identical. 

## Chapter 4: Investigating the sexually dimorphic transcriptome of a sex-role-reversed species expressing intermediate levels of sexual dimorphism, the northern pipefish (_Syngnathus fuscus_)
An analysis of RNA-sequencing data generated from reproductive and somatic tissues in males and females. In this analysis I investigated the presence of sex-biased gene expression and correlated it to measures of tissue-specific expression.

## Chapter 5: Investigating the sexually dimorphic transcriptome of a highly sexually dimorphic sex-role-reversed species, the Gulf pipefish (_Syngnathus scovelli_)
Using publicly accessible data I investigated the resolution of sexual conflict through mechanisms such as sex-biased gene expression.
