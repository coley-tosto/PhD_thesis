# Investigating the relationship between sexual selection, sexual conflict, and sex-biased gene expression
Presented here are the scripts and code used for data analyses in each data chapter of my thesis. Within each directoy are more details about the chapter contents and what tools were used. 

## Chapter 1: Sex-biased gene expression and sexual selection in a monomorphic species, the dusky pipefish (_Syngnathus floridae_)
An analysis of RNA-sequencing data across multiple tissues in males and females paired with a quantification of sexual selection pressures from mesocosm expreiments in a species where males and females look nearly identical. 

## Chapter 2: Sex-biased gene expression and sexual selection in an intermediately dimorphic species, the Nothern pipefish (_Syngnathus fuscus_)

## Chapter 3: Putting it all together: Tracking the evolution of sex-biased gene expression across three congeneric species with low, intermediate, and high levels of sexual dimorphism
